# HealthConnect - DeltaHacks11
 
In the Canadian healthcare system, long wait times have become a pervasive issue. Patients often endure hours of waiting for minor diagnoses such as a common cold, fever, or prescription refills. In Canada, waiting times for walk-in clinics is 68 minutes, accessing a hospital takes upwards of 3 hours, and accessing the ER takes upwards of 2 hours! These inefficiencies not only frustrate patients but also burden healthcare professionals who are already stretched thin, diverting their attention from more urgent or severe cases. Our project aims to alleviate this strain on the system by leveraging technology to provide patients with immediate guidance for non-critical health concerns, ultimately improving the healthcare experience for all stakeholders.
